# CLAUDE.md

"r" shortcut means READ CLAUDE.md and follow instructions.

Remember: if the user gave you this shortcut and it is not a beginnig of a chat, 
it is either: 
1) the chat was compacted
2) or YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG. Think about it and report. The answer most likely in the claude_behaviour.md and the chained docs.
